If your session includes tab groups, your tabs are grouped accordingly.","fullDescription":"Session Exporter lets you export your Firefox sessions to HTML files or save them to your bookmarks.\n\nNew in version 0.11:\n\n- Fixed a bug. If you use Session Exporter to export multiple session files to HTML files, or save them to bookmarks, and the session files come from different sources, there might be conflicting tab group IDs. Previously, Session Exporter did not detect these conflicts. As a result, it assigned tabs to incorrect tab groups because they had the same IDs as the correct tab groups. Now, Session Explorer resolves these conflicts. There is also a new user preference to merge tab groups that have the same ID, if they also have the same name.\n- When you export a session to an HTML file, the main table of contents now contains a link to the Duplicate Tabs section.\n- When you export a session to an HTML file, any duplicate tabs now contain links to the tab group sections that contain the original tabs.\n- Thank you to the reviewers for getting this bug fix through the review queue so quickly.\n\nNew in version 0.10:\n\n- Fixed a bug. If a tab group had no title, the link for that tab group in the Table of Contents had no text.\n- Fixed a bug. If you used Session Exporter to export bookmarks with missing titles to an HTML file, the links for those bookmarks had no text and could not be clicked. Session Exporter now detects this case and uses the URL of each bookmark as the title.\n- Fixed a bug. If you used Session Exporter to export a bookmark folder to an HTML file, it would use the bookmark folder name as the default file name in the file dialog, without adding the .html extension. As a result, it could overwrite an existing file with the same name on disk without asking permission. This was because the name of the file on disk had the .html extension, but the default file name in the file dialog did not, so comparing them returned a false negative. Session Exporter now adds the .html extension to the default file name to prevent this.\n- When you export a session and include tab histories, the tab histories are included for duplicate tabs as well as regular tabs.\n- You can now skip duplicate tabs across all tab groups as well as within each tab group (the default behavior).\n- You can export all bookmark folders, either to a single file, or to multiple files (one file for each folder).\n\nNew in version 0.9:\n\n- Fixed a bug. Session Exporter could not export a session that contained a tab that had failed to load. This was because the tab did not have a title. Session Exporter now detects this case and exports only the URL of the tab.\n- You can now select multiple sessions to export to a file or to your bookmarks, and the sessions are merged.\n- You can choose to skip duplicate tabs when exporting a single session or multiple sessions. You can choose to log the skipped duplicate tabs to the browser console. If you are exporting to a file, you can export the skipped duplicate tabs to a separate section of the file. If you are exporting to bookmarks, you can save the skipped duplicate tabs to a separate bookmark folder.\n- You can now export the entire history of each tab when exporting to a file. That is, the current URL of the tab is exported, followed by a list of all \"next\" and \"previous\" URLs for that tab.\n\nNew in version 0.8:\n\n- Fixed a bug in the settings dialog. The browse button for the default output folder did not work until you exported at least one session to a file.\n- Fixed a bug in the select output file dialog. Previously, if Session Exporter did not find the default output folder that was specified in the settings (for example, because it was deleted), it would raise an exception.\n- Added a setting for the default input folder, in case you don't store your sessions in the Firefox sessions folder.\n- After you export a session to a file, Session Exporter automatically opens the file in a new tab.\n\n*\n\n1. Export Session File(s) to HTML File.\n\n1a. Select one or more session files, then select the name of the HTML file where you want Session Exporter to export the session.\n\n1b. If you selected a single session file, Session Exporter reads the session in the session file and exports it to the HTML file. If you have tab groups, Session Exporter groups your tabs accordingly.\n\n1c. If you selected multiple session files, Session Exporter reads the sessions from all of the session files, combines them into a single session, and exports it to the HTML file. If Session Exporter finds the same tab group in multiple sessions, it combines the tabs that belong to that tab group in those sessions.\n\n- Note if the session files come from different sources (for example, different Firefox profiles or installations), they might contain tab groups with conflicting tab group IDs. In that case, Session Exporter resolves the conflict based on the \"When exporting multiple sessions, merge tab groups that have the same ID and title\" preference. For more information, see the Preferences section below.\n\n1d. Session Exporter shows an alert that tells you how many tabs and tab groups it exported. If you have set the appropriate preference to skip duplicate tabs, the alert also tells you how many duplicate tabs were found in the session(s). For more information about duplicate tabs, see the Preferences section below.\n\n*\n\n2. Export Current Session to HTML File.\n\n2a. Select the name of the HTML file where you want Session Exporter to export the session.\n\n2b. Session Exporter exports the current session to the HTML file. If you have tab groups, Session Exporter groups your tabs accordingly.\n\n2c. Session Exporter shows an alert that tells you how many tabs and tab groups it exported. If you have set the preference to skip duplicate tabs when exporting a single session, the alert also tells you how many duplicate tabs were found in the session. For more information about duplicate tabs, see the Preferences section below.\n\n*\n\n3. Export Session File(s) to HTML File (include tab history).\n\n3a. This is the same as Export Session File(s) to HTML File, except it also exports the history of each tab as well as the tab's current URL and title.\n\n- Note if the session files come from different sources (for example, different Firefox profiles or installations), they might contain tab groups with conflicting tab group IDs. In that case, Session Exporter resolves the conflict based on the \"When exporting multiple sessions, merge tab groups that have the same ID and title\" preference. For more information, see the Preferences section below.\n\n*\n\n4. Export Current Session to HTML File (include tab history).\n\n4a. This is the same as Export Current Session to HTML File, except it also exports the history of each tab as well as the tab's current URL and title.\n\n*\n\n5. Save Session File(s) to Bookmarks.\n\n5a. Select one or more session files, then enter the name of the new bookmark folder where you want Session Exporter to save the new bookmarks.\n\n5b. If you selected a single session file, Session Exporter reads the session in the session file and saves it to the new bookmark folder. If the session contains tab groups, Session Exporter creates a subfolder for each tab group, where it saves the bookmarks for tabs in that tab group.\n\n5c. If you selected multiple session files, Session Exporter reads the sessions from all of the session files, combines them into a single session, and saves that to the new bookmark folder.\n\n5d. Session Exporter shows an alert that tells you how many tabs and tab groups it saved. If you have set the appropriate preference to skip duplicate tabs, the alert also tells you how many duplicate tabs were found in the session(s). For more information about duplicate tabs, see the Preferences section below.\n\n*\n\n6. Save Current Session to Bookmarks.\n\n6a. Enter the name of the new bookmark folder where you want Session Exporter to save the new bookmarks.\n\n6b. Session Exporter saves the current session to the new bookmark folder. If the session contains tab groups, Session Exporter creates a subfolder for each tab group, where it saves the bookmarks for tabs in that tab group.\n\n6c. Session Exporter shows an alert that tells you how many tabs and tab groups it saved. If you have set the preference to skip duplicate tabs when exporting a single session, the alert also tells you how many duplicate tabs were found in the session. For more information about duplicate tabs, see the Preferences section below.\n\n*\n\nThere is no option to include the tab history when saving session file(s) or the current session to bookmarks. This is because it might require the creation of a very large number of bookmarks, which might cause Firefox to become unresponsive.\n\n*\n\n7. Export Bookmark Folder to HTML File.\n\n7a. Select one of the bookmark folders below the root bookmark folder.\n\n7b. Enter the name of the HTML file where you want Session Exporter to export the bookmark folder.\n\n7c. Session Exporter converts the bookmark folder to a session. The bookmark folder and its subfolders become tab groups, and the bookmarks become tabs. Session Exporter then exports the session to the HTML file.\n\n7d. Session Exporter shows an alert that tells you how many tabs and tab groups it exported. If you have set the preference to skip duplicate tabs when exporting a single session, the alert also tells you how many duplicate tabs were found in the session. For more information about duplicate tabs, see the Preferences section below.\n\n*\n\n8. Export All Bookmark Folders to HTML Files (one file per folder).\n\n8a. For each bookmark folder, enter the name of the HTML file where you want Session Exporter to export the bookmark folder. The default file name is the same as the bookmark folder name.\n\n8b. Session Exporter converts each bookmark folder to a session. The bookmark folder and its subfolders become tab groups, and the bookmarks become tabs. Session Exporter then exports the session to the HTML file.\n\n8c. For each bookmark folder, Session Exporter shows an alert that tells you how many tabs and tab groups it exported. If you have set the preference to skip duplicate tabs when exporting a single session, the alert also tells you how many duplicate tabs were found in the session. For more information about duplicate tabs, see the Preferences section below.\n\n*\n\n9. Export All Bookmark Folders to HTML File (one file for all folders).\n\n9a. Enter the name of the HTML file where you want Session Exporter to export the bookmark folders.\n\n9b. Session Exporter converts each bookmark folder to a session. The bookmark folder and its subfolders become tab groups, and the bookmarks become tabs. Session Exporter then combines the sessions into a single session and exports that to the HTML file.\n\n9c. Session Exporter shows an alert that tells you how many tabs and tab groups it exported. If you have set the appropriate preference to skip duplicate tabs, the alert also tells you how many duplicate tabs were found in the session(s). For more information about duplicate tabs, see the Preferences section below.\n\n*\n\nPreferences:\n\nInput Folder: When you select session files to export, the file dialog defaults to this folder.\n- When you first use Session Exporter, it locates your Firefox session folder automatically and sets this preference to that folder. If you are using the Session Manager add-on and have set a custom folder for session storage, Session Exporter sets this preference to that folder instead.\n- The Input Folder textbox is read-only. This is to prevent a non-valid folder from being entered. Please use the Browse button to select the input folder.\n\nOutput Folder: When you select the name of an HTML file where you want to export a session, the file dialog defaults to this folder.\n- When you export a session to an HTML file, Session Exporter sets this preference to the folder that contains the HTML file.\n- The Output Folder textbox is read-only. This is to prevent a non-valid folder from being entered. Please use the Browse button to select the output folder.\n\nWhen exporting multiple sessions, merge tab groups that have the same ID and title: When you export multiple sessions that come from different sources (for example, different Firefox profiles or installations), they might contain tab groups with conflicting tab group IDs. Session Exporter uses this preference to decide how to resolve these conflicts.\n- If the preference is checked, Session Exporter merges tab groups that have both the same ID and title. This is appropriate when you are exporting multiple snapshots of the same session from different dates, and you do not want the exported results to contain multiple copies of the same tab group. If two tab groups have the same ID but different titles, Session Exporter resolves the conflict without merging the tab groups.\n- If the preference is not checked, Session Exporter never merges tab groups, even if they have the same ID and title. This is appropriate when you are exporting sessions from different sources that might contain tab groups that have the same titles but different sets of tabs that you do not want to merge.\n\nSkip duplicate tabs when exporting a single session: When you export a single session, if the session contains duplicate tabs, Session Exporter skips them.\n- Duplicate tabs have the same URL and tab group ID. If two tabs have the same URL but belong to different tab groups, they are not considered duplicates. You can change this behavior by selecting \"Skip duplicate tabs across tab groups\". See the description for that preference.\n\nSkip duplicate tabs when exporting multiple sessions: When you export multiple sessions, if the combined session contains duplicate tabs, Session Exporter skips them.\n- Duplicate tabs have the same URL and tab group ID. If two tabs have the same URL but belong to different tab groups, they are not considered duplicates. You can change this behavior by selecting \"Skip duplicate tabs across tab groups\". See the description for that preference.\n\nSkip duplicate tabs across tab groups: By default, Session Exporter looks for duplicate tabs with the same URL and tab group ID. If you select this preference, Session Exporter looks for duplicate tabs with the same URL only. In other words, it looks for duplicate tabs across all tab groups.\n- If neither \"Skip duplicate tabs when exporting a single session\" nor \"Skip duplicate tabs when exporting multiple sessions\" is selected, this preference is disabled in the Preferences dialog, because it has no effect.\n\nLog skipped duplicate tabs to console: If Session Exporter finds duplicate tabs when exporting one or more sessions, it logs information about them to the Browser Console.\n- If neither \"Skip duplicate tabs when exporting a single session\" nor \"Skip duplicate tabs when exporting multiple sessions\" is selected, this preference is disabled in the Preferences dialog, because it has no effect.\n\nWhen exporting session to file, include skipped duplicate tabs in a separate section: If Session Exporter finds duplicate tabs when exporting one or more sessions to an HTML file, it includes them in a separate section of the file.\n- If neither \"Skip duplicate tabs when exporting a single session\" nor \"Skip duplicate tabs when exporting multiple sessions\" is selected, this preference is disabled in the Preferences dialog, because it has no effect.\n\nWhen saving session to bookmarks, include skipped duplicate tabs in a separate folder: If Session Exporter finds duplicate tabs when saving one or more sessions to bookmarks, it creates a subfolder to contain the duplicate tabs.\n- If neither \"Skip duplicate tabs when exporting a single session\" nor \"Skip duplicate tabs when exporting multiple sessions\" is selected, this preference is disabled in the Preferences dialog, because it has no effect.\n\n*\n\nI have found that when you open a session that contains tab groups, and then open new tabs in an existing tab group, Firefox might not immediately assign the new tabs to the tab group in the session data. As a result, if you use Session Exporter to export the current session, Session Exporter groups the new tabs in the \"None\" tab group.\n\nThis also happens if you save the session to a file and then use Session Exporter to export the session file.\n\nHowever, once you save the session file and then load it again, the tabs are assigned to the correct tab groups. At that point, if you use Session Exporter to export the current session, it groups the tabs in the correct tab groups.\n\n*\n\nSession Exporter uses Promise.jsm, so it requires Firefox 25 or higher. If you are not using Firefox 29 or higher, you might also need to enable the flag dom.promise.enabled in about:config. For more information, see the section \"Browser Compatibility\" in:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\n\nIf you have an add-on that changes the format of your Firefox session files, Session Exporter might not be able to read them.\n\nIf you have any problems or questions, please let me know at fsharpn00b@hotmail.com. If you can provide the session file, that will help me solve the problem faster. On the other hand, if Session Explorer helps you, please take a moment to review it. Even just one or two words are appreciated, as every review helps get the word out to more potential users.\n\nAll contributions go to Forget Me Not Animal Shelter.

It can also automatically save the state of open windows individually. The add-on is restartless and can be enabled and disabled on the fly.\n\nThis extension replaces SessionSaver and Tab Mix Plus' session manager. Session Manager is compatible with Tab Mix Plus. It can import sessions from both SessionSaver and Tab Mix Plus.\n\nSee http://sessionmanager.mozdev.org/documentation.html for the complete users and options guide.\n\nFeedback can be sent to support email address listed to the top right or at http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=2308889. The later is preferred.\n\nIf you are having problems, please open the Browser Console (Firefox/Tools -> Web Development -> Browser Console) and disable and re-enable Session Manager and look for errors in the error console. If there aren't any enable logging in the options menu and disabling and re-enable Session Manager again and send the logs to the email address listed on the right.\n\nNOTE: I CANNOT OFFER SUPPORT THROUGH THE REVIEW PAGES, PLEASE USE THE SUPPORT LINKS TO THE RIGHT. IF REPORTING A PROBLEM, PLEASE READ THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH FOR INSTRUCTIONS.","developerComments":"Note: Firefox 28 changes the way menus work. Session Manager doesn't display in the new minimized menu, but will still show in the old Tools menu which can be displayed by pressing the ALT key.\n\nPlease only post reviews here. For feedback or support use the support links above. Also see the home page for documentation.\n\nPOTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS:\n\n1. WARNING: IF YOU ENABLE ENCRYPTED SESSIONS AND RUN CCLEANER DO NOT ENABLE THE OPTION TO DELETE FIREFOX PASSWORDS. DOING SO WILL WIPE OUT THE KEY3.DB FILE IN YOUR FIREFOX PROFILE AND MAKE IT SO YOUR SESSION MANAGER SESSIONS CAN NOT BE DECRYPTED!\n\n2. Save button / menu item does not work and/or is grayed out - Likely your browser is set to \"Never remember history\" (i.e. permanent private browsing) history in the Privacy options. Due to Mozilla's policy that Add-ons MUST respect private browsing, Session Manager won't allow saving of private windows. This includes in backup sessions. Disable permanent private browsing and you will be able to save non-private windows again. If you don't like this, don't blame me, it's Mozilla's policy. See http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/02/23/private-browsing-support-required-for-add-ons/\n\n3. Recovering from a crash doesn't work - Crash recovery won't work at all if the user sets the option to never remember history or start up in permanent private browsing mode since no crash recovery data is saved by the browser. If you want to be able to recover from crashes don't set the browser to never remember browser history.","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/61/61138.png?src=api&modified=1341497052","width":"476","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/61/61138.png?src=api&modified=1341497052","thumbnailWidth":"136","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Session
