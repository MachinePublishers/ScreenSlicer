      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        ​3. Distribution Obligations.
            3.1. Availability of Source Code.
            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
        Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
        Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
        include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
        Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
        recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
        obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
        through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
            3.2. Modifications.
            The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by
        the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are
        Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights
        conveyed by this License.
            3.3. Required Notices.
            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You
        as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any
        copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
        any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
        Contributor or the Initial Developer.
            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
        form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
        recipients’ rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
        for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
        recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
        absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
        obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the
        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
        Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
        terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
        contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
        with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
        not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code form
        from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
        Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
        absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
        You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
        indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
        offer.
            3.6. Larger Works.
            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
        not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
        single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
        License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
        ​4. Versions of the License.
            4.1. New Versions.
            Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
        versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other
        than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
            4.2. Effect of New Versions.
            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
        originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
        notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
        otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
        distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
        version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
        Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
        published by the license steward.
            4.3. Modified Versions.
            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
        Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
        License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of
        the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
        and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ
        from this License.
        ​5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
        MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
        TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
        COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
        OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
        CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
        LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
        THIS DISCLAIMER.
        ​6. TERMINATION.
            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
        breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
        their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
        survive.
            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
        judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
        Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
        "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
        Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
        the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
        patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
        Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
        Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
        shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
        automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
        such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
        Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
        agreement with Participant.
            6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
        that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
        such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
        initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
        licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
        into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
            6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
        user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
        prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
        shall survive termination.
        ​7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
        NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
        CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
        SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
        FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
        ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
        INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
        NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
        PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        ​8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
            The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
        C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that
        term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer
        software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
        Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
        (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
        those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
        and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
        Government rights in computer software under this License.
        ​9. MISCELLANEOUS.
            This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
        hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
        provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
        This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a
        notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable
        law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s
        conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be
        subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue
        specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
        party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
        reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
        Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
        excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
        shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
        agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States
        export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of
        any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any
        Covered Software.
        ​10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
        for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
        of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
        Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
        herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
        NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE
        (CDDL)
        The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
        California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to
        this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
        Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
        with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

        This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.
        This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can
        be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, moves information on
        style sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the Copyright FAQ, reflects that ERCIM is 
        now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of 
        the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". See the older 
        formulation for the policy prior to this date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for
        common questions about using materials from our site, such as the translating
        or annotating specifications. Other questions about this notice can be directed
        to site-policy@w3.org.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        1. Definitions.
           "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
           and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
           "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
           the copyright owner that is granting the License.
           "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
           other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
           control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
           "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
           direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
           otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
           outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
           "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
           exercising permissions granted by this License.
           "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
           including but not limited to software source code, documentation
           source, and configuration files.
           "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
           transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
           not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
           and conversions to other media types.
           "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
           Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
           copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
           (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
           "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
           form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
           editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
           represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
           of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
           separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
           the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
           "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
           the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
           to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
           submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
           or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
           the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
           means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
           to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
           communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
           and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
           Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
           excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
           designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
           "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
           on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
           subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
           copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
           publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
           Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
           (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
           use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
           where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
           by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
           Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
           with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
           institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
           cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
           or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
           or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
           granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
           as of the date such litigation is filed.
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
           Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
           modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
           meet the following conditions:
           (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
               Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
           (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
               stating that You changed the files; and
           (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
               that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
               attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
               the Derivative Works; and
           (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
               distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
               include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
               within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
               pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
               of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
               as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
               documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
               within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
               wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
               do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
               notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
               or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
               that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
               as modifying the License.
           You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
           may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
           for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
           for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
           reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
           the conditions stated in this License.
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
           any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
           by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
           this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
           Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
           the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
           with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
           names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
           except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
           origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
           agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
           Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
           WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
           implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
           of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
           PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
           appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
           risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
           whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
           unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
           negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
           liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
           incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
           result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
           Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
           work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
           other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
           has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
           the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
           and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
           or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
           License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
           on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
           of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
           defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
           incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
           of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
           To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
           boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

           file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
           same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
           identification within third-party archives.

        THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
        COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
        COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
        AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
        BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
        BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
        CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
        HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
        1. Definitions
        a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
        pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
        arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
        phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
        other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including
        in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
        constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose
        of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
        work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
        timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
        Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
        b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
        encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
        other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
        which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
        constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
        entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
        constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
        assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will
        not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
        License.
        c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies
        of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of
        ownership.
        d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
        offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
        e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the

        h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to

        provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law
        or other applicable laws.
        3. License Grant.
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants
        You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
        the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as
        stated below:
        a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
        Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
        b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
        including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
        label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
        Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
        translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
        original work has been modified.";
        c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
        Collections;
        d. and, to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
        e. For the avoidance of doubt:
        i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the 
        right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme 
        cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such 
        royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; 
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right 
        to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be 
        waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any 
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, 
        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, 
        whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting 
        society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any 
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. 
        The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
        or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
        modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
        media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
        by Licensor are hereby reserved.
        4. Restrictions.
        The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
        limited by the following restrictions:
        a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
        this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
        (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
        Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
        restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
        Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
        License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
        that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
        copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
        Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
        measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
        from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
        the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
        Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
        itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
        Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
        practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
        4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
        Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
        credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
        b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
        Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
        4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
        to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
        (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
        and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
        institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
        Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
        reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
        Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
        any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
        does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
        and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
        credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
        translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
        Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
        implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
        a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
        for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
        part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
        for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
        use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
        manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You
        may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
        sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
        Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
        the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
        Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
        c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
        otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
        Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
        Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
        action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
        Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
        (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of
        this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
        distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial
        to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
        assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
        applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
        under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
        otherwise.
        5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.
        UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
        OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
        CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
        DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
        DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        6. Limitation on Liability.
        EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE
        LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
        PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
        WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        7. Termination.
        a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
        upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
        who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
        however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
        entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
        7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
        b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
        perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
        Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
        under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
        provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
        License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
        under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
        force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
        8. Miscellaneous.
        a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
        Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
        conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
        b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
        offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
        conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
        c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
        remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
        parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
        extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
        d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
        consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
        the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
        e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
        respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
        representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
        not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
        communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
        written agreement of the Licensor and You.
        f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
        License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
        the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
        1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
        WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
        Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
        take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
        sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
        implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
        the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
        additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
        deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
        restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
