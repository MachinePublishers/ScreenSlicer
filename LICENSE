                         CONDITIONAL PERMISSIONS

For definitions of terms, see: GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 - TERMS AND CONDITIONS -
Definitions which appears below in this document.

Machine Publishers, LLC offers Permissions under GNU GPL version section 7 conditionally upon
Obligations being satisfied. These Conditional Permissions are as follows.

Permissions:

  1) to link the Program with subprograms not compatible with the GNU Affero General Public License
version 3 or the GNU General Public License v3; and

  2) to forego the requirements of Section 13 in the License; and

  3) to be indemnified in the event of intellectual property or patent infringement claims based
solely on the Corresponding Source of the unmodified original work; and

  4) to receive good faith answers via electronic message in a timely manner to routine questions
about the general installation or API usage of the Program; and

  5) to officially, and publicly should you choose, file bug reports and feature requests for the
Program and receive good faith responses in a timely manner; and

  6) to apply these Conditional Permissions to all future Program updates released by Machine
Publishers, LLC under this License; and

  7) to include jBrowserDriver (a separate work by Machine Publishers, LLC) as part of the Program
in this License and Conditional Permissions.

Obligations:

  1) You must not convey these Permissions to others; and

  2) If you modified the covered work or were party to its modification, all contributors must
exclusively and irrevocably transfer and assign in perpetuity all right, title, and interest,
throughout the world, in the modified work (excluding linked subprograms) to Machine Publishers, LLC
which will in turn license those modifications to you under this License, and all contributors must
sign and share agreements affirming such transfers and assignments, and all contributors must
promptly send a copy of the Corresponding Source of the modified work (excluding linked subprograms)
to Machine Publishers, LLC; and

  3) Except for anyone under your direction and control and on terms prohibiting making copies of
modified versions of the Program or linked subprograms outside the relationship with you, who is
making modifications to the Program or linked subprograms exclusively on your behalf or who is
providing you with facilities for running the Program, modified versions of the Program, or linked
subprograms exclusively on your behalf, you must not allow anyone else to:

         a) Access the Program, modified versions of the Program, or linked subprograms except
through remote network interaction, running on servers or platforms provided by or paid for by you,
as an application or application programming interface (API); or

         b) Access the Program APIs or any functionally similar derivative APIs; or

         c) Access or use the Program, modified versions of the Program, or linked subprograms in
any way, directly or indirectly, unless you add significant and primary functionality to the
Program; or

         d) Make a copy of modified versions of the Program or linked subprograms; and

  4) You must pay $14500 or $2850/year or $385/month (USD) to Machine Publishers, LLC. Yearly and
monthly payment plans are on a recurring basis for eight (8) years or 96 months, respectively. There
are no cancellation fees for ending payments early on recurring plans, but you must notify Machine
Publishers, LLC in writing in advance of cancellations, and if eight (8) yearly payments or 96
monthly payments have not been made, then the Permissions are revoked and you must immediately
comply with the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 without the benefit of the Permissions;
and

  5) If you are paying on a yearly or monthly basis, then Machine Publishers, LLC must receive
payments by the same day each year or month, respectively, from when payments were initiated.
Payments to Machine Publishers, LLC must be received on time and via a payment method and processor
acceptable to Machine Publishers, LLC in its sole discretion. Late payments, missed payments,
bounced checks, fraudulent payments, lost or undelivered payments, or disputed credit charges
constitute non-payment and a violation of these Obligations. Violations of the Obligations because
of non-payment shall be excused by Machine Publishers, LLC if you pay an additional $10 USD per day
for each day your account is past due and if your account is past due for no more than 180 days in
any 365 day period. If you prefer not to pay $10 USD per day for each day your account is past due
or if your account is past due for more than 180 days in any 365 day period, then the Permissions
are revoked, you must immediately comply with the GNU Affero General Public License version 3
without the benefit of the Permissions, and you must pay the past due amount plus interest on it at
an annualized 15%.

Any claim relating to the license or Machine Publishers, LLC shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Ohio without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Nothing in these Obligations restricts your rights under the License, as the License does not grant
you these Permissions otherwise. If you remove any of these Obligations prior to acceptance of the
License, then the Permissions are automatically removed too. The terms in these Permissions and
Obligations supersede any possible conflicting terms in the License, which is permissible given that
Machine Publishers, LLC as the copyright holder can issue dual or alternate licensing. Machine
Publishers, LLC reserves the right to modify these terms or reject offering these Permissions by
providing prompt notice and, if any initial payment has beeen received, by providing a prompt refund
too.

                     END OF CONDITIONAL PERMISSIONS


                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    You can redistribute this program and/or modify it under the terms of the
    GNU Affero General Public License version 3 as published by the Free
    Software Foundation.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Affero General Public License version 3
    for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    version 3 along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

        ​3. Distribution Obligations.
            3.1. Availability of Source Code.
            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
        Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
        Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
        include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
        Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
        recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
        obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
        through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
            3.2. Modifications.
            The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by
        the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are
        Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights
        conveyed by this License.
            3.3. Required Notices.
            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You
        as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any
        copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
        any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
        Contributor or the Initial Developer.
            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
        form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
        recipients’ rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
        for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
        recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
        absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
        obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the
        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
        Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
        terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
        contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
        with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
        not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code form
        from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
        Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
        absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
        You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
        indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
        offer.
            3.6. Larger Works.
            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
        not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
        single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
        License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
        ​4. Versions of the License.
            4.1. New Versions.
            Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
        versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other
        than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
            4.2. Effect of New Versions.
            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
        originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
        notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
        otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
        distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
        version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
        Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
        published by the license steward.
            4.3. Modified Versions.
            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
        Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
        License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of
        the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
        and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ
        from this License.
        ​5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
        MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
        TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
        COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
        OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
        CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
        LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
        THIS DISCLAIMER.
        ​6. TERMINATION.
            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
        breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
        their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
        survive.
            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
        judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
        Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
        "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
        Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
        the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
        patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
        Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
        Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
        shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
        automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
        such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
        Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
        agreement with Participant.
            6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
        that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
        such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
        initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
        licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
        into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
            6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
        user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
        prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
        shall survive termination.
        ​7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
        NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
        CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
        SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
        FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
        ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
        INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
        NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
        PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        ​8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
            The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
        C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that
        term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer
        software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
        Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
        (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
        those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
        and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
        Government rights in computer software under this License.
        ​9. MISCELLANEOUS.
            This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
        hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
        provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
        This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a
        notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable
        law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s
        conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be
        subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue
        specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
        party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
        reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
        Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
        excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
        shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
        agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States
        export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of
        any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any
        Covered Software.
        ​10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
        for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
        of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
        Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
        herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
        NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE
        (CDDL)
        The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
        California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to
        this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
        Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
        with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

        behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
        clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
        offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer

        originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
        notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
        otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
        distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
        version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
        Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
        published by the license steward.

        judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
        Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
        .Participant.) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
        Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
        the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
        patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
        Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
        Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
        shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
        automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
        such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
        Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
        agreement with Participant.
              6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
        user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder

        This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.
        This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can
        be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, moves information on
        style sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the Copyright FAQ, reflects that ERCIM is 
        now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of 
        the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". See the older 
        formulation for the policy prior to this date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        1. Definitions.
           "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
           and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
           "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
           the copyright owner that is granting the License.
           "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
           other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
           control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
           "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
           direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
           otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
           outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
           "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
           exercising permissions granted by this License.
           "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
           including but not limited to software source code, documentation
           source, and configuration files.
           "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
           transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
           not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
           and conversions to other media types.
           "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
           Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
           copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
           (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
           "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
           form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
           editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
           represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
           of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
           separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
           the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
           "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
           the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
           to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
           submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
           or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
           the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
           means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
           to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
           communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
           and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
           Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
           excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
           designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
           "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
           on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
           subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
           copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
           publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
           Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
           (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
           use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
           where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
           by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
           Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
           with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
           institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
           cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
           or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
           or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
           granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
           as of the date such litigation is filed.
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
           Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
           modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
           meet the following conditions:
           (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
               Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
           (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
               stating that You changed the files; and
           (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
               that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
               attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
               the Derivative Works; and
           (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
               distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
               include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
               within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
               pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
               of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
               as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
               documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
               within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
               wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
               do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
               notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
               or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
               that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
               as modifying the License.
           You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
           may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
           for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
           for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
           reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
           the conditions stated in this License.
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
           any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
           by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
           this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
           Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
           the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
           with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
           names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
           except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
           origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
           agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
           Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
           WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
           implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
           of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
           PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
           appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
           risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
           whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
           unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
           negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
           liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
           incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
           result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
           Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
           work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
           other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
           has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
           the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
           and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
           or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
           License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
           on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
           of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
           defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
           incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
           of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
        COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
        COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
        AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
        BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
        BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
        CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
        HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
        1. Definitions
        a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
        pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
        arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
        phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
        other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including
        in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
        constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose
        of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
        work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
        timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
        Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
        b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
        encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
        other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
        which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
        constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
        entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
        constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
        assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will
        not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
        License.
        c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies
        of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of
        ownership.
        d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
        offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
        e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
        individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
        individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in
        the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
        persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
        perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
        case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first
        fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
        broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
        f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
        this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
        scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
        expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
        writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
        dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in
        dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic
        work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
        cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,
        engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
        expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an
        illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
        geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
        phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a
        copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to
        the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
        g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
        who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
        Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
        rights under this License despite a previous violation.
        h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
        communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process,
        including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make
        available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may
        access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
        to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the
        communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by
        public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
        means including signs, sounds or images.
        i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
        without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation
        and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
        performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
        2. Fair Dealing Rights.
        Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses
        free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are
        provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law
        or other applicable laws.
        3. License Grant.
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants
        You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
        the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as
        stated below:
        a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
        Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
        b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
        including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
        label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
        Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
        translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
        original work has been modified.";
        c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
        Collections;
        d. and, to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
        e. For the avoidance of doubt:
        i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the 
        right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme 
        cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such 
        royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; 
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right 
        to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be 
        waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any 
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, 
        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, 
        whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting 
        society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any 
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. 
        The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
        or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
        modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
        media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
        by Licensor are hereby reserved.
        4. Restrictions.
        The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
        limited by the following restrictions:
        a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
        this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
        (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
        Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
        restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
        Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
        License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
        that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
        copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
        Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
        measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
        from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
        the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
        Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work
        itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
        Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
        practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
        4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
        Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
        credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
        b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
        Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
        4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
        to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
        (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
        and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
        institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
        Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
        reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
        Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
        any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
        does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
        and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
        credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
        translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
        Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
        implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
        a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
        for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
        part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
        for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
        use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
        manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You
        may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
        sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
        Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
        the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
        Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
        c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
        otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
        Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
        Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
        action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
        Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
        (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of
        this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
        distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial
        to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
        assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
        applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
        under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
        otherwise.
        5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.
        UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
        OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
        CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
        DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
        DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        6. Limitation on Liability.
        EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE
        LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
        PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
        WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        7. Termination.
        a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
        upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
        who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
        however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
        entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
        7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
        b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
        perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
        Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
        under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
        provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
        License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
        under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
        force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
        8. Miscellaneous.
        a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
        Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
        conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
        b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
        offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
        conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
        c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
        remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
        parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
        extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
        d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
        consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
        the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
        e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
        respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
        representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
        not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
        communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
        written agreement of the Licensor and You.
        f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
        License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
        the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
        1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
        WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
        Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
        take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
        sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
        implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
        the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
        additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
        deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
        restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
